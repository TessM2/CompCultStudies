But before we do that, I'd like us to talk a little bit about debugging code (fixing it) understanding code (reading other peopel's) and getting help doing both. Since you're beginners in python, most of the code you encounter is going to be hard to understand. And, since your humans, a lot of that code is also going to need some adaptation to be run in your own contexts (i.e., on the text you want to run it on, etc.). So I want us to practice together understanding someone else's code - when it's complicated - with the help of google and chatbots, and fixing it. To that end, let's use a block of code Melanie Walsh used a lot in her textbook. One issue with this code, for us, is that a lot of it isn't yet totally comprehensible to us as beginning coders. Another issue is that Melanie loads in files in a certain way, for Jupyter notebook, but we've learned that we load in files differently in colab.
