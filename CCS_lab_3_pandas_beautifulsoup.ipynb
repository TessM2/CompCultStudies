A strong, resolute, business-like man, who by possession of unlimited resources in men and money, and by the unsparing use of them, had been enabled to wear down and exhaust the strength of the South, this was what I supposed Grant to be, this and little more.\n","\n","Some documents published by General Badeau in the American newspapers first attracted my serious attention to Grant.\n","\n","Among those documents was a letter from him which showed qualities for which, in the rapid and uncharitable view which our cursory judgments of men so often take, I had by no means given him credit.\n","\n","It was the letter of a man with the virtue, rare everywhere, but more rare in America, perhaps, than anywhere else, the virtue of being able to confront and resist popular clamour, the civium ardor prava jubentium. Public opinion seemed in favour of a hard and insolent course, the authorities seemed putting pressure upon Grant to make him follow it. He resisted with firmness and dignity.\n","\n","After reading that letter I turned to General Grant's Personal Memoirs, then just published.\n","\n","This man, I said to myself, deserves respect and attention; and I read the two bulky volumes through.\n","\n","\n","I found shown in them a man, strong, resolute, and business-like, as Grant had appeared to me when I first saw him; a man with no magical personality, touched by no divine light and giving out none.\n","\n","I found a language all astray in its use of will and shall, should and would, an English employing the verb to conscript and the participle conscripting, and speaking in a despatch to the Secretary of War of having badly whipped the enemy; an English without charm and without high breeding.\n","\n","But at the same time I found a man of sterling good-sense as well as of the firmest resolution; a man, withal, humane, simple, modest; from all restless self-consciousness and desire for display perfectly free; never boastful where he himself was concerned, and where his nation was concerned seldom boastful, boastful only in circumstances where nothing but high genius or high training, I suppose, can save an American from being boastful.\n","\n","I found a language straightforward, nervous, firm, possessing in general the high merit of saying clearly in the fewest possible words what had to be said, and saying it, frequently, with shrewd and unexpected turns of expression.\n","\n","The Memoirs renewed and completed the expression which the letter given by General Badeau had made upon me. And now I want to enable Grant and his Memoirs as far as possible to speak for themselves to the English public, which knows them, I believe, as imperfectly as a few months ago I myself did.\n","\n","General Grant was born at Point Pleasant, in the State of Ohio, on the 27th of April, 1822.\n","\n","His name, Ulysses, makes one think of Tristram Shandy; but how often do American names make one think of Tristram Shandy! The father of the little Ulysses followed the trade of a tanner; he was a constant reader both of books and newspapers, and before he was twenty years of age was a constant contributor, his son tells us, to Western newspapers, and was also, from that time, until he was fifty years old, an able debater in the societies for this purpose, which were then common in the West.\n","Of many and many an American farmer and tradesman this is the history.\n","\n","General Grant, however, never shared the paternal and national love for public speaking.\n","\n","As to his schooling, he never, he tells us, missed a quarter from school, from the time he was old enough to attend till the time when he left home, at the age of seventeen, for the Military Academy at West Point.\n","\n","But the instruction in the country schools at that time was very poor:--\n","\n","A single teacher — who was often a man or a woman incapable of teaching much, even if they imparted all they knew — would have thirty or forty scholars, male and female, from the infant learning the A B C, up to the young lady of eighteen and the boy of twenty studying the highest branches taught — the three R's. I never saw an algebra, or other mathematical work higher than the arithmetic, until after I was appointed to West Point.\n","\n","I then bought a work on algebra in Cincinnati; but, having no teacher, it was Greek to me.\n","\n","This schooling is unlike that of our young gentlemen preparing for Sandhurst or Woolwich, but still more unlike theirs is Grant's life out of school-hours.\n","\n","He has told us how regularly he attended his school, such as it was.

Unless a great success came to restore the spirit of the North, it seemed probable that the draft would be resisted, that men would begin to desert, and that the power to capture and punish deserters would be lost.\\n\\nIt was Grant's conviction that there was nothing left to be done but to go forward to a decisive victory.\\n\\nAt first, wever, after the battle of Shiloh and the taking of Corinth, he could accomplish little.\\n\\nGeneral Halleck, his chief, appears to have been at this time ill-disposed to him, and to have treated him with coldness and incivility.\\n\\nIn July 1862, General Halleck was appointed general-in-chief of all the armies of the North, with his headquarters in Washington, and Grant remained in Tennessee in chief command.\\n\\nBut his army suffered such depletion by detaching men to defend long lines of communication, to repair ruined railroads, to reinforce generals in need of succour, that he found himself entirely on the defensive in a hostile territory.\\n\\nNevertheless in a battle fought to protect Corinth he repulsed the enemy with great slaughter, and being no longer anxious for the safety of the territory within his command, and having been reinforced, he resolved on a forward movement against Vicksburg.\\n\\nVicksburg occupies the first high ground on the Mississippi below Memphis.\\n\\nCommunication between the parts of the Confederacy divided by the Mississippi was through Vicksburg, So long as the Confederates held Vicksburgand Port Hudson lower down, the free navigation of the river was prevented.\\n\\nThe fall of Vicksburg, as the event proved, was sure to bring with it the fall of Port Hudson also.\\n\\nGrant saw nearly his whole force absorbed in holding the railway lines north of Vicksburg; he-considered that if he moved forward, driving the enemy before him into Southern territory not as yet subdued, those lines in his rear would almost hold themselves, and most of his force would be free for field operations.\\n\\nBut in moving forward he moved further from his bases of supplies.\\n\\nOne of these was at Holly Springs, in the north of the state of Mississippi; the enemy appeared there, captured the garrison, and destroyed all the stores of food, forage, and munitions of war. This loss taught Grant a lesson by which he, and Sherman after him, profited greatly: the lesson that in a wide and productive country, such as that in which he was operating, to cling to a distant base of supply was not necessary; the country he was in would afford the supplies needed.\\n\\nHe was amazed, he says, when he was compelled by the loss of Holly Springs to collect supplies in the country immediately around him, at the abundant quantity which the country afforded.\\n\\nHe found that after leaving two months supplies for the use of the families whose stores were taken, he could, off the region where he was, have subsisted his army for a period four times as long as he had actually to remain there.\\n\\nLater in the campaign he took full advantage of the experience thus gained.\\n\\nThe fleet under Admiral Porter co-operated with him, but all endeavours to capture Vicksburg from the north were unavailing.\\n\\nThe Mississippi winds and winds through its rich alluvial valley; the country is intersected by bayous or water-courses filled from the river, with overhanging trees and with narrow and tortuous channels, where the bends could not be turned by a vessel of any length.\\n\\nTo cross this country in the face of an enemy was impossible.\\n\\nThe problem was to get in rear of the object of attack, and to secure a footing upon dry ground on the high or eastern side of the Mississippi \\u2014 the side on which Vicksburg stands \\u2014 for operating against the place.\\n\\nOn the 30th of January, 1863, Grant having left Memphis, took the command at Young's Point in Louisiana, on the western bank of Mississippi, not far above Vicksburg, bent on solving the problem.\\n\\nIt was a wet country and a wet winter, with high water in the Mississippi and its tributaries.\\n\\nThe troops encamped on the river bank had, in order to be out of the water, to occupy the levees, or dykes, along the river edge, and the ground immediately behind.\\n\\nThis gave so limited a space, that one corps of Grant's army, when he assumed the command at Young's Point, was at Lake Providence, seventy miles above Vicksburg.\\n\\nThe troops suffered much from malarial fevers and other sickness, but the hospital arrangements were excellent.\\n\\nFour ineffectual attempts were in the course of the winter made to get at the object of attack by various routes.\\n\\nGrant, meanwhile, was maturing his plan.\\n\\nHis plan was to traverse the peninsula where he lay encamped, then to cross the Mississippi, and thus to be able to attack Vicksburg from the south and east.\\n\\nAbove Young's Point, at Milliken's Bend, begins a series of bayous, forming, as it were, the chord of an immense bend of the Mississippi, and falling into the river some fifty miles below Vicksburg.\\n\\nBehind the levees bordering these bayous were tolerable roads, by which, as soon as they emerged from the waters, Grant's troops and waggon-trains could cross the peninsula.\\n\\nThe difficulties were indeed great: four bridges had to be built across wide bayous, and the rapid fall of the waters increased the current, and made bridge-building troublesome; but at work of this kind the Yankee soldier is in his element.\\n\\nBy the 24th of April Grant had his headquarters at the southern extremity of the bend.\\n\\nThe navy under Admiral Porter, escorting steamers and barges to serve as ferries and for the transport of supplies, had run fourteen miles of batteries, passed Vicksburg, and come down the river to join Grant.\\n\\nA further march of twenty-two miles was still necessary in order to reach the first high ground, where the army might land and establish itself on the eastern shore.\\n\\nThis first high land is at Grand Gulf, a place strongly held at that time by the Confederates, and as unattackable from the river as Vicksburg itself.\\n\\nPorter ran the batteries of Grand Gulf as he had run those of Vicksburg; the army descended the river a few miles, and on the 30th of April was landed at Bruinsburg, on the eastern shore, without meeting an enemy.\\n\\nGrant's plan had succeeded.\\n\\nHe was established on the eastern bank, below and in rear of Vicksburg.\\n\\nThough Vicksburg was not yet taken, and though he was in the enemy's country, with a vast river and the stronghold of Vicksburg between him and his base of supplies, yet he felt a degree of relief scarcely ever equalled, since I was on dry ground on the same side of the river with the enemy.\\n\\nAnd indeed from this moment his success was continuous.\\n\\nThe enemy had at Grand Gulf, at Haines Bluff north of Vicksburg, and at Jackson, the capital of the State of Mississippi, in which State all these places are, about 60,000 men. After fighting and losing an action to cover Grand Gulf, the Confederates evacuated that place, and Grant occupied it on the 3rd of May.\\n\\nBy the 7th of May Sherman joined him at Grand Gulf, and he found himself with a force of 33,000 men. He then determined at once to attack the enemy's forces in the rear of Vicksburg, and then to move on the stronghold itself.\\n\\nIn order to use Grand Gulf as his base of supplies for these operations, he must have constructed additional roads, and this would have been a work of time.\\n\\nHe determined therefore merely to bring up by the single road available from Grand Gulf, what rations of biscuit, coffee, and salt he could, and to make the country he traversed furnish everything else.\\n\\nBeef, mutton, poultry, molasses, and forage were to be found, he knew, in abundance.\\n\\nThe cautious Halleck would be sure to disapprove this bold plan of almost abandoning the base of supplies, but Grant counted on being able to obtain his object before he could be interfered with from Washington.\\n\\nThe nature of the ground making Vicksburg easily defensible on the south, Grant deter.\\n\\nmined to get on the railroad running east from Vicksburg to Jackson, the State capital, and to approach the stronghold from that side.\\n\\nAt Jackson was a strong Confederate force, the city was an. important railway centre, and all supplies of men and stores for Vicksburg came thence; this source of aid had to be stopped.\\n\\nBut in order to reach Jackson, Grant had to abandon even that one road by which he had partially supplied his army hitherto, to cut loose from his base of supplies altogether.\\n\\nHe did so without hesitation.\\n\\nAfter a successful action he entered Jackson on the 14th of May, driving out of it the Confederates under General Johnston, and destroyed the place in so far as it was a railroad centre and a manufactory of military supplies.\\n\\nThen he turned westward, and after a severe battle shut up Pemberton in Vicksburg.\\n\\nAn assault on Pemberton's defences was unsuccessful, but Vicksburg was closely invested.\\n\\nPemberton's stores began to run short.\\n\\nJohnston was unable to come to his relief, and on the 4th of July, Independence Day, he surrendered Vicksburg, with its garrison of nearly thirty-two thousand men, ordnance and stores.\\n\\nAs Grant had fore.\\n\\nseen, Port Hudson surrendered as soon as the fall of Vicksburg became known, and the great river was once more open from St. Louis to the sea.\\n\\nIn the north the victory of Gettysburg was won on the same day on which Vicksburg surrendered.\\n\\nA load of anxiety was lifted from the minds of the President and his ministers; the North took heart again, and resolved to continue the war with energy, in the hope of soon bringing it to a triumphant issue.\\n\\nThe great and decisive event bringing about this change was the fall of Vicksburg, and the merit of that important success was due to Grant.\\n\\nHe had been successful, and in his success he still retained his freedom from bounce and from personal vanity; his steadfast concern for the public good; his moderation.\\n\\nLet us hear his account of being under fire during a fruitless attack by Admiral Porter's gunboats on the batteries of Grand Gulf: \\n\\n\\n I occupied a tug, from which I could see the effect of the battle on both sides, within range of the enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was not calculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were being assailed themselves.\\n\\n\\n I occupied a tug, from which I could see the effect of the battle on both sides, within range of the enemy's guns; but a small tug, without armament, was not calculated to attract the fire of batteries while they were being assailed themselves.\\n\\nHe has to mention a risk incurred by himself; but mentioning it, he is at pains to minimise it. \\n\\nWhen he assumed command in person at Young's Point, General McClernand, from whom the command now passed to Grant, his senior and superior, showed temper and remonstrated: \\n\\n\\nHis correspondence with me on the subject was more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest.\\n\\nIt was highly insubordinate, but I overlooked it, as I believed, for the good of the service. General McClernand was a member of Congress when the Secession War broke out; he belonged to that party which furnished all the opposition there was to a vigorous prosecution of the war for saving the Union; but there was no delay in his declaring himself for the Union at all hazards, and there was no uncertain sound in his declaration of where he stood in the contest before the country.\\n\\n\\nHis correspondence with me on the subject was more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest.\\n\\nIt was highly insubordinate, but I overlooked it, as I believed, for the good of the service.

I took no steps to answer these complaints, but continued to do my duty, as I understood it, to the best of my ability.\\n\\n\\n Visitors to the camps went home with dismal stories.\\n\\nNorthern papers came back to the soldiers with these stories exaggerated.\\n\\nBecause I would not divulge my ultimate plans to visitors they pronounced me idle, incompetent, and unfit to command men in an emergency, and clamoured for my removal.\\n\\nThey were not to be satisfied, many of them, with my simple removal, but named who my successor should be. I took no steps to answer these complaints, but continued to do my duty, as I understood it, to the best of my ability.\\n\\nSurely the Duke of Wellington would have read these Memoirs with pleasure.\\n\\nHe might himself have issued, too, this order respecting behaviour to prisoners: Instruct the commands to be quiet and orderly as these prisoners pass, and to make no offensive remark.\\nAnd this other, respecting behaviour in a conquered enemy's country: Impress upon the men the importance of going through the State in an orderly manner, abstaining from.\\n\\ntaking anything not absolutely necessary for their subsistence while travelling.\\n\\nThey should try to create as favourable an impression as possible upon the people.\\n\\nBut what even at this stage of the war is very striking, and of good augury for the re-union which followed, is the absence, in general, of bitter hatred between the combatants.\\n\\nThere is nothing of internicene, inextinguishable, irreconcilable enmity, or of the temper, acts, and words which beget this.\\n\\nOften we find the vanquished Southerner showing a good-humoured audacity, the victorious Northerner a good-humoured forbearance.\\n\\nLet us remember Carrier at Nantes, or Davoust at Hamburg, and then look at Grant's picture of himself and Sherman at Jackson, when their troops had just driven the enemy out of this capital of a rebel State, and were destroying the stores and war-materials there: \\n\\n\\nSherman and I went together into a manufactory which had not ceased work on account of the battle, nor for the entrance of Yankee troops.\\n\\nOur entrance did not seem to attract the attention of either the manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls.\\n\\nWe looked on for a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of the looms, with C. S. A. \\n\\nConfederate States Army. woven in each bolt.\\n\\nFinally I told Sherman I thought they had done work enough.\\n\\nThe operatives were told they could leave, and take with them what cloth they could carry.\\n\\nIn a few minutes the factory was in a blaze.\\n\\nThe proprietor visited Washington, while I was President, to get his pay for this property, claiming that it was private.\\n\\n\\nSherman and I went together into a manufactory which had not ceased work on account of the battle, nor for the entrance of Yankee troops.\\n\\nOur entrance did not seem to attract the attention of either the manager or the operatives, most of whom were girls.\\n\\nWe looked on for a while to see the tent cloth which they were making roll out of the looms, with\\nConfederate States Army.\\n\\nThe American girls coolly continuing to make the Confederate tents under the eye of the hostile generals, and the proprietor claiming afterwards to be paid by Congress for them as private property, are charming.\\n\\nIt was one of Grant's superstitions, he tells us, never to apply for a post, or to use, personal or political influence for obtaining it. He believed that if he had got it in this way he would have feared to undertake any plan of his own conception for fear of involving his patrons in responsibility for his possible failure.\\n\\nIf he were selected for a post, his responsibility ended, he said, with his doing the best he knew how.\\n\\nEvery one has his superstitions.\\n\\nOne of mine is that in positions of great responsibility every one should do his duty to the best of his ability, where assigned by competent authority, without application or the use of influence to change his position.\\n\\nWhile at Cairo I had watched with very great interest the operations of the Army of the Potomac, looking upon that as the main field of the war. I had no idea, myself, of ever having any large command, nor did I suppose that I was equal to one; but I had the vanity to think that, as a cavalry officer, I might succeed very well in the command of a brigade.\\n\\nOn one occasion, in talking about this to my staff officers, I said that I would give anything if I were commanding a brigade of cavalry in the Army of the Potomac, and I believed I could do some good.\\n\\nCaptain Hellyer suggested that I should make application to be transferred there to command the cavalry.\\n\\nI then told him that I would cut my right arm off first, and mentioned this superstition.\\n\\nBut now he was to be transferred, without any solicitation on his own part, to the main field of the war.\\nAt first, however, he was appointed to the command of the Military division of the Mississippi, and after fighting a severe and successful battle at Chattanooga in November (1863), relieved that place and Knoxville, which the Confederates were threatening.\\n\\nPresident Lincoln, who had daily, almost hourly, been telegraphing to him to remember Burnside, to do something for Burnside, besieged in Knoxville, was overjoyed.\\n\\nI wish, he wrote to Grant, to tender you, and all under your command, my more than thanks, my profoundest gratitude, for the skill, courage and perseverance with which you and they, over so great difficulties, have effected this important object.\\n\\nGod bless you all!\\nCongress voted him thanks and a gold medal for his achievements at Vicksburg and Chattanooga.\\n\\nIn the dead of the winter, with the thermometer below zero, he made an excursion into Kentucky, and had the pleasure of finding the people along his route, both in Tennessee and Kentucky, in general intensely loyal to the Union: \\n\\n\\nThey would collect in little places where we would stop of evenings, to see me. The people naturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person in the party.\\n\\nI was then forty-one years of age, while my medical director was grey-haired, and probably twelve or more years my senior.\\n\\nThe crowds would generally swarm around him, and thus give me an opportunity of quietly dismounting and getting into the house.\\n\\n\\nThey would collect in little places where we would stop of evenings, to see me. The people naturally expected to see the commanding general the oldest person in the party.\\n\\nI was then forty-one years of age, while my medical director was grey-haired, and probably twelve or more years my senior.\\n\\nThe crowds would generally swarm around him, and thus give me an opportunity of quietly dismounting and getting into the house.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the next year, 1864, a Bill was passed through Congress for restoring the grade of Lieutenant-General in the army.\\n\\nGrant was nominated to that rank, and having been summoned to Washington he received his commission from the President on the 9th of March, in the presence of the Ministers.\\n\\nBefore he came to Washington, he had meant to return to his command in the West even after being made lieutenant-general; but at Washington he saw reason to change his mind.\\n\\nThe important struggle was now between the Army of the Potomac and Lee. From what he saw, Grant was convinced that in that struggle no one except himself, with the superior rank he now bore, could, probably, resist the pressure that would be brought to bear upon him to desist from his own plans and pursue others.\\nHe obtained, therefore, the nomination of Sherman to succeed him in command of the Military Division of the Mississippi.\\n\\nOn the 12th of March orders were published by the War Department, placing Grant in chief command of all the armies.\\n\\nThe position of General Meade, who was at that time in command of the Army of the Potomac, and who had won the important battle of Gettysburg in the previous summer, underwent a grave change through Grant's promotion.\\n\\nBoth Meade and Grant behaved very well.\\n\\nMeade suggested to Grant that he might wish to have immediately under him Sherman, who had been serving with Grant in the West.\\n\\nHe begged him not to hesitate in making the change if he thought it for the good of the service.\\n\\nThe work in hand, he said, was of such vast importance, that the feelings and wishes of no one person should stand in the way of selecting the right men. He was willing himself to serve to the best of his ability wherever placed.\\n\\nGrant assured him that he had no thought of moving him, and in his Memoirs, after relating what had passed, he adds: This incident gave me even a more favorable opinion of Meade than did his great victory at Gettysburg the July before.\\n\\nIt is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.\\nHe tried to make Meade's position as nearly as possible what it would have been had he himself been away in Washington or elsewhere; he gave all orders for the movements of the Army of the Potomac to Meade for execution, and to avoid the necessity of having to give direct orders himself, he established his headquarters close to Meade's whenever he could.\\n\\nMeade's position, however, was undoubtedly a somewhat embarrassing one; but its embarrassment was not increased by soreness on his part, or by want of delicacy on Grant's.\\n\\nIn the West, the great objects to be attained by Sherman were the defeat of Johnston and his army, and the occupation of Atlanta.\\n\\nThese objects he accomplished, proceeding afterwards to execute his brilliant and famous march to Savannah and the sea, sweeping the whole State of Georgia.\\n\\nIn the East, the opposing forces stood between the Federal and Confederate capitals, and substantially in the same relations to each other as when the war began three years before.\\n\\nPresident Lincoln told Grant, when he first saw him in private, that although he had never professed to know how campaigns should be conducted, and never wanted to interfere in them, yet procrastination on the part of commanders, and the pressure from the people at the North and Congress, which was always with him, forced him into issuing his series of Military Orders.\\n\\nHe did not know but they were all wrong, and did know that some of them were.\\n\\nWhat he wanted, he continued, was a general who would take the responsibility and act; he would support him with all the power of the Government.\\nHe added that he did not even ask to know what Grant's plans were.\\n\\nBut such is human nature, that the next moment he brought out a map of Virginia, showed Grant two streams running into the Potomac, and suggested a plan of his own for landing the army between the mouths of these streams, which would protect its flanks while it moved out. I listened respectfully, says Grant, with dry humour, but did not suggest that the same streams would protect Lee's flanks while he was shutting us up.\\n\\nIn Grant the President had certainly found a general who would take the responsibility, would act, and would keep his plans to himself.\\n\\nTo beat Lee and get possession of his army, was the object.\\n\\nIf Lee was beaten and his army captured, the fall of Richmond must necessarily follow.\\n\\nIf Richmond were taken by moving the army thither on transports up the James River, but meanwhile Lee's army were to remain whole and unimpaired, the end of the war was not brought any nearer.\\n\\nBut the end of the war must be reached soon, or the North might grow weary of continuing the struggle.\\n\\nFor three years the war had raged, with immense losses on either side, and no decisive consummation reached by either.\\n\\nIf the South could succeed in prolonging an indecisive struggle year after year still, the North might probably grow tired of the contest, and agree to a separation.\\n\\nPersuaded of this, Grant, at the beginning of May 1864, crossed the Rapidan with the Army of the Potomac, and commenced the forty-three days Campaign of the Wilderness.\\n\\nThe Wilderness is a tract north of Richmond, between the Rapidan and the James River, much cut up with streams and morasses, full of broken ground, densely clothed with wood, and thinly inhabited.\\n\\nThe principal streams between the Rapidan and the James River are the branches of the Anna, uniting in the Pamunkey, and the Chickahominy.\\n\\nThe country was favorable for defence, and Lee was a general to make the most of its advantages.\\n\\nGrant was in an enemy's country, but, moving by his left flank, was in connection with the sea, of which the Northerners were masters, and was abundantly supplied with everything.\\n\\nOf artillery, in particular, he had so much that he was embarrassed by it, and had to send some of it away.\\n\\nOverwhelmingly superior in numbers and resources, he pressed steadily forward, failing and repulsed sometimes, but coolly persevering.\\n\\nThis campaign, of which the stages are the battles of Chancellorsville, Spottsylvania, North Anna and Cold Harbour, was watched at the time in Europe with keen attention, and is much better known than the operations in the West.\\n\\nI shall not attempt any account of it; for its severity let the losses of Grant's successful army speak.\\n\\nWhen he crossed the Rapidan the Army of the Potomac numbered 115,000 men; during the forty-three days campaign reinforcements were received amounting to 40,000 men more.\\n\\nWhen the army crossed the James River, it was 116,000 strong, almost exactly the same strength as at the beginning of the campaign.\\n\\nThirty-nine thousand men had been lost in forty-three days.\\n\\nA yet greater loss must have been incurred had Grant attacked Lee's lines in front of Richmond; and therefore crossing the James River, he invested, after failing to carry it by assault, Petersburg, the enemy's important stronghold south of Richmond.\\n\\nWinter came and passed.\\n\\nLee's army was safe in its lines, and Richmond had not yet fallen; but the Confederates' resources were failing, their foes gathering, and the end came visibly near.\\n\\nAfter sweeping Georgia and taking Savannah in December, Sherman turned north and swept the Carolinas, ready to join with Grant in moving upon Lee in the spring.\\n\\nSheridan made himself master of the Shenandoah Valley, and closed to the Confederates that great source of supply.\\n\\nFinally Grant, resuming operations in March 1865, possessed himself of the outer works of Petersburg, and of the railroad by which the place was supplied from the southwest, and on the 3rd of April Petersburg was evacuated.\\n\\nThen Grant proceeded to possess himself of the railroad by which Lee's army and Richmond itself now drew their supplies.\\n\\nLee had already informed his government that he could hold out no longer.\\n\\nThe Confederate President was at church when the despatch arrived, the congregation were told that there would be no evening service, and the authorities abandoned Richmond that afternoon.\\n\\nIn the field there was some sharp fighting for a day or two still; but Lee's army was crumbling away, and on the 9th of April he wrote to Grant, requesting an interview with him for the purpose of surrendering his army.\\n\\nGrant was suffering from sick headache when the officer bearing Lee's note reached him, but the instant I saw, he says, the contents of the note, I was cured.\\n\\nThen followed, in the afternoon of that same day, the famous interview at Appomattox Court House.\\n\\nGrant shall himself describe the meeting: \\n\\n\\nWhen I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the result that was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.\\n\\nI was without a sword, as I usually was when on horseback in the field, and wore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder-straps of my rank to indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I found General Lee.\\n\\nWe greeted each other, and, after shaking hands, took our seats.\\n\\nWhat General Lee's feelings were I do not know.\\n\\nAs he was a man of much dignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether he felt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over the result and was too manly to show it. Whatever his feelings, they were entirely concealed from my observation; but my own feelings, which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter, were sad and depressed.\\n\\nI felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who.had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought.\\n\\nGeneral Lee was dressed in a full uniform which was entirely new, and was wearing a sword of considerable value, very likely tile sword which had been presented by the State of Virginia.\\n\\nIn my rough travelling suit, tile uniform of a private with the straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted very strangely with a man so handsomely dressed, six feet high and of faultless form.\\n\\nBut this was not a matter that I thought of until afterwards.\\n\\n\\n We soon fell into a conversation about old army times.\\n\\nHe remarked that he remembered me well in the old army (of Mexico); and I told him that as a matter of course I remembered him perfectly, but from the difference in our rank and years (there being about sixteen years difference in our ages) I had thought it likely that I had not attracted his attention sufficiently to be remembered by him after such a long interval.\\n\\nOur conversation grew so pleasant that I almost forgot the object of our meeting.\\n\\nAfter the conversation had run on in this style for some time, General Lee called my attention to the object of our meeting, and said that he had asked for this interview for the purpose of getting from me the terms I proposed to give his army.\\n\\nI said that I meant merely that his army should lay down their arms, not to take them up again during the continuance of the war unless duly and properly exchanged. \\n\\n\\nWhen I had left camp that morning I had not expected so soon the result that was then taking place, and consequently was in rough garb.\\n\\nI was without a sword, as I usually was when on horseback in the field, and wore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder-straps of my rank to indicate to the army who I was. When I went into the house I found General Lee.\\n\\nWe greeted each other, and, after shaking hands, took our seats.\\n\\nWhat General Lee's feelings were I do not know.\\n\\nAs he was a man of much dignity, with an impassible face, it was impossible to say whether he felt inwardly glad that the end had finally come, or felt sad over the result and was too manly to show it.

Johnston surrendered to Sherman in North Carolina.\\n\\nPresident Lincoln visited Richmond, which had been occupied by the Army of the Potomac the day after the Confederate Government abandoned it. The President on his return to Washington invited Grant, who also had now gone thither, to accompany him to the theatre on the evening of the 14th of April.\\n\\nGrant declined, because he was to go off that evening to visit his children who were at school in New Jersey; when he reached Philadelphia, he heard that the President and Mr. Seward had been assassinated.\\n\\nHe immediately returned to Washington, to find the joy there turned to mourning.\\n\\nWith this tragic event, and with the grand review in the following month of Meade's and Sherman's armies by the new President, Mr. Johnson, the Memoirs end.\\n\\nModest for himself, Grant is boastful, as Americans are apt to be, for his nation.\\n\\nHe says with perfect truth that troops who have fought a few battles and won, and followed up their victories, improve upon what they were before to an extent that can hardly be counted by percentage; and that his troops and Sherman's which had gone through this training, were by the end of the war become very good and seasoned soldiers.\\n\\nBut he is fond of adding, in what I must call the American vein,  better than any European soldiers.\\nAnd the reason assigned for this boast is in the American vein too: Because they not only worked like a machine, but the machine thought.\\n\\nEuropean armies know very little what they are fighting for, and care less.\\nIs the German army a machine which does not think?\\n\\nDid the French revolutionary armies know very little what they were fighting for, and care less?\\n\\nSainte-Beuve says charmingly that he cannot bear to have it said that he is the first in anything; it is not a thing that can be admitted, and these ways of classing people give offence.\\nGerman military men read Grant's boast, and are provoked into replying that the campaigns and battles of the American Civil War were mere struggles of militia; English military men say that Americans have been steady enough behind breastworks and entrenchments against regulars, but never in the open field.\\n\\nWhy cannot the Americans, in speaking of their nation, take Sainte-Beuve's happy and wise caution?\\n\\nThe point is worth insisting on, because to be always seeking to institute comparisons, and comparisons to the advantage of their own country, is with so many Americans a tic, a mania, which every one notices in them, and which sometimes drives their friends half to despair.\\n\\nRecent greatness is always apt to be sensitive and self-assertive; let us remember Dr. Hermann Grimm on Goethe.\\n\\nGerman literature, as a power, does not begin before Lessing; if Germany had possessed a great literature for six centuries, with names in it like Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare, probably Dr. Hermann Grimm would not have thought it necessary to call Goethe the greatest poet that has ever lived.\\n\\nBut the Americans in the rage for comparison-making beat the world.\\n\\nWhatever excellence is mentioned, America must, if possible, be brought in to balance or surpass it. That fine and delicate naturalist, Mr. Burroughs, mentions trout, and instantly he adds: British trout, by the way, are not so beautiful as our own; they are less brilliantly marked and have much coarser scales, there is no gold or vermilion in their colouring.\\nHere superiority is claimed; if there is not superiority there must be at least balance.\\n\\nTherefore in literature we have the American Walter Scott, the American Wordsworth ; nay, I see advertised The Primer of American Literature. Imagine the face of Philip or Alexander at hearing of a Primer of Macedonian Literature!\\n\\nAre we to have a Primer of Canadian Literature too, and a Primer of Australian?\\n\\nWe are all contributories to one great literature \\u2014 English Literature.\\n\\nThe contribution of Scotland to this literature is far more serious and important than that of America has yet had time to be; yet a Primer of Scotch Literature would be an absurdity.\\n\\nAnd these things are not only absurd; they are also retarding.\\n\\nMy opinion on any military subject is of course worth very little, but I should have thought that in what Napier calls strength and majesty as a fighter, the American soldier, if we are to institute these comparisons, had his superiors; though as brave as any one, he is too ingenious, too mental, to be the perfection of a fighting animal.\\n\\nWhere the Yankee soldier has an unrivalled advantage is in his versatility and ingenuity; dexterous, willing, suggestive, he can turn his hand to anything, and is of twenty trades at the same time with that of soldier.\\n\\nGrant's Memoirs are full of proofs of this faculty, which might perhaps be of no great use in a campaign in the Low Countries, but was invaluable in such campaigns as those which Grant and Sherman conducted in America.\\n\\nWhen the batteries at Vicksburg were to be run with hired river steamers, there were naturally but very few masters or crews who were willing to accompany their vessels on this service of danger.\\n\\nVolunteers were therefore called for from the army, men who had any experience in river navigagation.\\n\\nCaptains, pilots, mates, engineers, and deck-hands, enough presented themselves, says Grant, to take five times the number of vessels we were moving.\\nThe resource and rapidity shown by the troops in the repair of railroads wrecked by the enemy were marvellous.\\n\\nIn Sherman's Atlanta campaign, the Confederate cavalry lurking in his rear to burn bridges and obstruct his communications had become so disgusted at hearing trains go whistling by, within a few hours after a bridge had been burned, that they proposed to try blowing up some of the tunnels.\\n\\nOne of them said on this: No use, boys; old Sherman carries duplicate tunnels with him, and will replace them as fast as you can blow them up; better save your powder!\\n\\nBut a leader to use these capable and intelligent forces, to use all the vast resources of the North, was needed, a leader wise, cool, firm, bold, persevering, and at the same time, as Cardinal Mazarin says, heureux; and such a leader the United States found in General Grant.\\n\\nHe concludes his Memoirs by some advice to his own country and some remarks on ours.\\n\\nThe United States, he says, are going on as if in the greatest security, when they have not the power to resist an invasion by the fleets of fourth-rate European Powers for a time until we could prepare for them.\\nThe United States should have a good navy, and our sea-coast defences should be put in the finest possible condition.\\n\\nNeither of these cost much when it is considered where the money goes and what we get in return.\\n\\nThe tone and temper of his remarks on England, and on her behaviour during the war, are in honourable contrast with the angry acrimony shown by many who should have known better.\\n\\nHe regretted, he said, the exasperation.\\n\\nThe hostility of England to the United States, during our rebellion, was not so much real as it was apparent.\\n\\nIt was the hostility of the leaders of one political party.\\n\\nEngland and the United States are natural allies, and should be the best of friends.\\n\\nThe Memoirs stop, as I have said, in 1865, and do not embrace Grant's Presidency, his journey to Europe, his financial disaster, his painful illness and death.\\n\\nAs to his financial disaster, I will repeat what one of Grant's best friends, a man of great business faculty and of great fortune, remarked to me. I had been saying, what one says so easily, that it was a pity Grant had suffered himself to be drawn in by speculators.\\n\\nYes, answered his friend, it was a pity.\\n\\nBut see how it happened, and put yourself in Grant's place.\\n\\nLike Grant, you may have a son to whom you are partial, and like Grant, you have no knowledge of business.\\n\\nHad you been, like Grant, in a position to make it worth while for a leader in business and finance to come to you, saying that your son had a quite exceptional talent for these matters, that it was a thousand pities his talent should be thrown away, give him to me and I will make a man of him, would you not have been flattered in your parental pride, would you not have yielded?\\n\\nThis is what happened to Grant, and all his financial misfortunes flowed from hence.\\nI listened, and could not deny that most probably I should have been flattered to my ruin, as Grant was.\\n\\nGrant's Memoirs are a mine of interesting things; I have but scratched the surface and presented a few samples.\\n\\nWhen I began, I did not know that the book had been reprinted in England; I find that it has,\\n\\nBy Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston & Co., and that its circulation here, though trifling indeed compared to that in America, has been larger than I supposed.\\n\\nBut certainly the book has not been read here anything like so much as it deserves.\\n\\nIt contains a gallery of portraits, characters of generals who served in the war, for which alone the book, if it contained nothing else, would be well worth reading.\\n\\nBut after all, its great value is in the character which, quite simply and unconsciously, it draws of Grant himself.\\n\\nThe Americans are too self-laudatory, too apt to force the tone and thereby, as Sainte-Beuve says, to give offence; the best way for them to make us forgive and forget this is to produce what is simple and sterling.\\n\\nInstead of Primers of American Literature, let them bring forth more Maxims of Poor Richard; instead of assurances that they are the greatest nation upon earth, let them give us more Lees, Lincolns, Shermans, and Grants.\\n\\n \\nBy Messrs. Sampson Low, Marston & Co.,\\nA word about America.\\n\\n \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":38}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["OK, so, this could be useful, if you work with xml files.

The fruit is variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich instarchcovered with apeel, which may have a variety of colors when ripe. It grows upward in clusters near the top of the plant. Almost all modern edible seedless (parthenocarp) cultivated bananas come from two wild species –Musa acuminataandMusa balbisiana, or hybrids of them.\n","Musaspecies are native to tropicalIndomalayaandAustralia; they were probablydomesticatedinNew Guinea. They are grown in 135 countries, primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to makebanana paperandtextiles, while some are grown asornamental plants. The world's largest producers of bananas in 2022 were India and China, which together accounted for approximately 26% of total production. Bananas are eaten raw or cooked in recipes varying from curries tobanana chips,fritters, fruit preserves, or simply baked or steamed.\n","Worldwide, there is no sharp distinction between dessert \"bananas\" and cooking \"plantains\": this works well enough in the Americas and Europe, but it breaks down inSoutheast Asiawhere many more kinds of bananas are grown and eaten. The term \"banana\" is applied also to other members of the genusMusa, such as thescarlet banana(Musa coccinea), thepink banana(Musa velutina), and theFe'i bananas. Members of the genusEnsete, such as thesnow banana(Ensete glaucum) and the economically importantfalse banana(Ensete ventricosum) of Africa are sometimes included.

Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as it is at least 60 centimetres (2.0 ft) deep, has good drainage and is not compacted.[4]They are fast-growing plants, with a growth rate of up to 1.6 metres (5.2 ft) per day.[5]\n","The leaves of banana plants are composed of a stalk (petiole) and a blade (lamina). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem, the edges are forced apart.[3]Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around 5 m (16 ft) tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around 3 m (10 ft) to 'Gros Michel' at 7 m (23 ft) or more.[6][7]Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) long and 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide.[1]When a banana plant is mature, the corm stops producing new leaves and begins to form a flower spike orinflorescence. A stem develops which grows up inside the pseudostem, carrying the immature inflorescence until eventually it emerges at the top.[3]Each pseudostem normally produces a single inflorescence, also known as the \"banana heart\". After fruiting, the pseudostem dies, but offshoots will normally have developed from the base, so that the plant as a whole isperennial.[8]The inflorescence contains many petal-likebractsbetween rows of flowers. The female flowers (which can develop into fruit) appear in rows further up the stem (closer to the leaves) from the rows of male flowers. The ovary isinferior, meaning that the tiny petals and other flower parts appear at the tip of the ovary.[9]\n","The banana fruits develop from thebanana heart, in a large hanging cluster called abunch, made up of around nine tiers calledhands, with up to 20 fruits to a hand. A bunch can weigh 22–65 kilograms (49–143 lb).[10]The stalk ends of the fruits connect up to therachispart of the inflorescence. Opposite the stalk end, is theblossomend, where the remnants of the flower deviate the texture from the rest of the flesh inside the peel.\n","The fruit has been described as a \"leathery berry\".[11]There is a protective outer layer (apeelor skin) with numerous long, thin strings (Vascular bundles), which run lengthwise between the skin and the edible inner white flesh. The peel is less palatable and usually discarded after peeling the fruit, optimally done from the blossom end, but often started from the stalk end. The inner part of the common yellow dessert variety can be split lengthwise into three sections that correspond to the inner portions of the threecarpelsby manually deforming the unopened fruit.[12]In cultivated varieties, fertile seeds are usually absent.[13][14]\n","A 2011 phylogenomic analysis using nuclear genes indicates thephylogenyof some representatives of theMusaceaefamily.

TheAPG III systemassigns Musaceae to the orderZingiberales, part of thecommelinidclade of themonocotyledonousflowering plants. Some 70 species ofMusawere recognized by theWorld Checklist of Selected Plant Familiesas of January 2013[update];[18]several produce edible fruit, while others are cultivated as ornamentals.[22]\n","The classification of cultivated bananas has long been a problematic issue for taxonomists. Linnaeus originally placed bananas into two species based only on their uses as food:Musa sapientumfor dessert bananas andMusa paradisiacaforplantains. More species names were added, but this approach proved to be inadequate for the number ofcultivarsin the primarycenter of diversityof the genus, Southeast Asia. Many of these cultivars were given names that were later discovered to besynonyms.[23]\n","In a series of papers published from 1947 onward, Ernest Cheesman showed that Linnaeus'sMusa sapientumandMusa paradisiacawere cultivars and descendants of two wild seed-producing species,Musa acuminataandMusa balbisiana, both first described byLuigi Aloysius Colla.[24]Cheesman recommended the abolition of Linnaeus's species in favor of reclassifying bananas according to three morphologically distinct groups of cultivars – those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics ofMusa balbisiana, those primarily exhibiting the botanical characteristics ofMusa acuminata, and those with characteristics of both.[23]Researchers Norman Simmonds and Ken Shepherd proposed a genome-based nomenclature system in 1955. This system eliminated almost all the difficulties and inconsistencies of the earlier classification of bananas based on assigning scientific names to cultivated varieties. Despite this, the original names are still recognized by some authorities, leading to confusion.[24][25]\n","The acceptedscientific namesfor most groups of cultivated bananas areMusa acuminataCollaandMusa balbisianaCollafor the ancestral species, andMusa×paradisiacaL.for the hybrid of the two.[16]\n","An unusual feature of the genetics of the banana is thatchloroplast DNAis inherited maternally, whilemitochondrial DNAis inherited paternally. This facilitates taxonomic study of species and subspecies relationships.[26]\n","In regions such as North America and Europe,Musafruits offered for sale can be divided into small sweet \"bananas\" eaten raw when ripe as a dessert, and large starchy \"plantains\" orcooking bananas, which do not have to be ripe. Linnaeus made this distinction when naming two \"species\" ofMusa.[27]Members of the \"plantain subgroup\" of banana cultivars, most important as food in West Africa and Latin America, correspond to this description, having long pointed fruit. They are described by Ploetz et al. as \"true\" plantains, distinct from other cooking bananas.[28]\n","The cooking bananas of East Africa belong to a different group, theEast African Highland bananas.[7]Further, small farmers in Colombia grow a much wider range of cultivars than large commercial plantations do,[29]and in Southeast Asia—the center of diversity for bananas, both wild and cultivated—the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" does not work. Many bananas are used both raw and cooked. There are starchy cooking bananas which are smaller than those eaten raw. The range of colors, sizes and shapes is far wider than in those grown or sold in Africa, Europe or the Americas.[27]Southeast Asian languages do not make the distinction between \"bananas\" and \"plantains\" that is made in English. Thus both Cavendish dessert bananas andSaba cooking bananasare calledpisangin Malaysia and Indonesia,kluaiin Thailand andchuốiin Vietnam.[30]Fe'i bananas, grown and eaten in the islands of the Pacific, are derived from a different wild species. Most Fe'i bananas are cooked, butKarat bananas, which are short and squat with bright red skins, are eaten raw.[31]\n","The earliest domestication of bananas (Musaspp.) was from naturally occurringparthenocarpic(seedless) individuals ofMusa banksiiinNew Guinea.[32]These were cultivated byPapuansbefore the arrival ofAustronesian-speakers. Numerousphytolithsof bananas have been recovered from theKuk Swamparchaeological site and dated to around 10,000 to 6,500BP.[33][34]Foraginghumans in this area began domestication in the latePleistoceneusingtransplantationand earlycultivationmethods.[35]By the early to middle of theHolocenethe process was complete.[35]From New Guinea, cultivated bananas spread westward intoIsland Southeast Asia. Theyhybridizedwith other (possibly independently domesticated)subspeciesofMusa acuminataas well asM. balbisianain the Philippines, northern New Guinea, and possiblyHalmahera. These hybridization events produced the triploidcultivars of bananascommonly grown today.[33]The banana was one of the key crops thatenabled farming to beginin Papua New Guinea.[36]\n","From Island Southeast Asia, bananas became part of the staple domesticated crops ofAustronesian peoples.[33][34]\n","These ancient introductions resulted in the banana subgroup now known as thetrue plantains, which include theEast African Highland bananasand thePacific plantains(theIholenaandMaoli-Popo'ulusubgroups). East African Highland bananas originated from banana populations introduced to Madagascar probably from the region betweenJava,Borneo, andNew Guinea; while Pacific plantains were introduced to the Pacific Islands from either eastern New Guinea or theBismarck Archipelago.[33]\n","21st century discoveries ofphytolithsin Cameroon dating to the first millennium BCE[37]triggered a debate about the date of first cultivation in Africa. There is linguistic evidence that bananas were known in East Africa or Madagascar around that time.[38]The earliest prior evidence indicates that cultivation dates to no earlier than the late 6th century AD.[39]Malagasy peoplecolonized Madagascar from South East Asia around 600 AD onwards.[40]Glucanaseand two other proteins specific to bananas were found indental calculusfrom the earlyIron Age(12th century BCE)PhilistinesinTel Eraniin the southernLevant.[41]\n","Another wave of introductions later spread bananas to other parts of tropical Asia, particularly Indochina and the Indian subcontinent.[33]Some evidence suggests bananas were known to theIndus Valley civilisationfrom phytoliths recovered from theKot Dijiarchaeological site in Pakistan.[34]Southeast Asia remains the region ofprimary diversityof the banana. Areas of secondary diversity are found in Africa, indicating a long history of banana cultivation there.[42]\n","The banana may have been present in isolated locations elsewhere in the Middle East on the eve ofIslam. Thespread of Islamwas followed by far-reaching diffusion. There are numerous references to it in Islamic texts (such as poems andhadiths) beginning in the 9th century. By the 10th century, the banana appeared in texts fromPalestineand Egypt. From there it diffused into North Africa andMuslim Iberiaduring theArab Agricultural Revolution.[43][44]An article on banana tree cultivation is included inIbn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work,Kitāb al-Filāḥa(Book on Agriculture).[45]During the Middle Ages, bananas fromGranadawere considered among the best in the Arab world.[44]Bananas were certainly grown in the ChristianKingdom of Cyprusby the late medieval period. Writing in 1458, the Italian traveller and writerGabriele Capodilistawrote favourably of the extensive farm produce of the estates at Episkopi, near modern-dayLimassol, including the region's banana plantations.[46]\n","In theearly modern period, bananas were encountered by European explorers during theMagellan expeditionin 1521, in bothGuamand thePhilippines. Lacking a name for the fruit, the ship's historianAntonio Pigafettadescribed them as \"figs more than onepalmlong.\"[47][48]: 130, 132Bananas were introduced toSouth Americaby Portuguese sailors who brought them from West Africa in the 16th century.[49]Southeast Asian banana cultivars, as well asabacagrown for fibers, were introduced to North and Central America by the Spanish from the Philippines, via theManila galleons.[50]\n","In the 15th and 16th centuries, Portuguese colonists started banana plantations in the Atlantic Islands, Brazil, and western Africa.[53]North Americans began consuming bananas on a small scale at very high prices shortly after the Civil War, though it was only in the 1880s that the food became more widespread.[54]As late as theVictorian Era, bananas were not widely known in Europe, although they were available.[53]\n","The earliest modern plantations originated in Jamaica and the relatedWestern Caribbean Zone, including most ofCentral America. Plantation cultivation involved the combination of modern transportation networks of steamships and railroads with the development of refrigeration that allowed more time between harvesting and ripening. North American shippers likeLorenzo Dow BakerandAndrew Preston, the founders of theBoston Fruit Companystarted this process in the 1870s, with the participation of railroad builders likeMinor C. Keith. Development led to the multi-national giant corporations likeChiquitaandDole.[54]These companies weremonopolistic,vertically integrated(controlling growing, processing, shipping and marketing) and usually used political manipulation to buildenclave economies(internally self-sufficient, virtually tax exempt, and export-oriented, contributing little to the host economy). Their political maneuvers, which gave rise to the termbanana republicfor states such as Honduras and Guatemala, included working with local elites and their rivalries to influence politics or playing the international interests of the United States, especially during theCold War, to keep the political climate favorable to their interests.[55]\n","The vast majority of the world's bananas are cultivated for family consumption or for sale on local markets. They are grown in large quantities in India, while many other Asian and African countries host numerous small-scale banana growers who sell at least some of their crop.[56]Peasants with smallholdings of 1 to 2 acres in the Caribbean produce bananas for the world market, often alongside other crops.[57]In many tropical countries, the main cultivars produce green (unripe) bananas used forcooking. Because bananas and plantains produce fruit year-round, they provide a valuable food source during thehunger seasonbetween harvests of other crops, and are thus important for globalfood security.[58]\n","Bananas are propagatedasexuallyfrom offshoots. The plant is allowed to produce two shoots at a time; a larger one for immediate fruiting and a smaller \"sucker\" or \"follower\" to produce fruit in 6–8 months.[8]As a non-seasonal crop, bananas are available fresh year-round.[59]They are grown in some 135 countries.[60]\n","In global commerce in 2009, by far the most important cultivars belonged to the triploidMusa acuminataAAA groupof Cavendish group bananas.[61]Disease is threatening the production of the Cavendish banana worldwide. It is unclear if any existing cultivar can replace Cavendish bananas, so varioushybridisationandgenetic engineeringprograms are attempting to create a disease-resistant, mass-market banana. One such strain that has emerged is the Taiwanese Cavendish or Formosana.[62][63][64]\n","Export bananas are picked green, and ripened in special rooms upon arrival in the destination country. These rooms are air-tight and filled withethylene gasto induce ripening. This mimics the normal production of this gas as a ripening hormone.[65][66]Ethylene stimulates the formation ofamylase, anenzymethat breaks down starch into sugar, influencing the taste. Ethylene signals the production ofpectinase, a different enzyme which breaks down thepectinbetween the cells of the banana, causing the banana to soften as it ripens.[65][66]The vivid yellow color many consumers in temperate climates associate with bananas is caused by ripening around 18 °C (64 °F), and does not occur in Cavendish bananas ripened in tropical temperatures (over 27 °C (81 °F)), which leaves them green.[67][68]\n","Bananas are transported over long distances from the tropics to world markets.[69]To obtain maximum shelf life, harvest comes before the fruit is mature. The fruit requires careful handling, rapid transport to ports, cooling, and refrigerated shipping. The goal is to prevent the bananas from producing their natural ripening agent, ethylene. This technology allows storage and transport for 3–4 weeks at 13 °C (55 °F). On arrival, bananas are held at about 17 °C (63 °F) and treated with a low concentration of ethylene. After a few days, the fruit begins to ripen and is distributed for final sale. Ripe bananas can be held for a few days at home. If bananas are too green, they can be put in a brown paper bag with an apple or tomato overnight to speed up the ripening process.[70][71]\n","The excessive use of fertilizers contributes greatly toeutrophicationin streams and lakes, harming aquatic life, while expanding banana production has led to deforestation. As soil nutrients are depleted, more forest is cleared for plantations. This causes soil erosion and increases the frequency of flooding.[72]\n","Voluntary sustainability standardssuch asRainforest AllianceandFairtradeare being used to address some of these issues. Banana production certified in this way grew rapidly at the start of the 21st century to represent 36% of banana exports by 2016.[73]However, such standards are applied mainly in countries which focus on the export market, such as Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Guatemala; worldwide they cover only 8–10% of production.[74]\n","Mutation breedingcan be used in this crop.Aneuploidyis a source of significant variation inallotriploidvarieties. For one example, it can be a source ofTR4 resistance.Lab protocolshave been devised to screen for such aberrations and for possible resulting disease resistances.[75]WildMusaspp.provide useful resistance genetics, and are vital to breeding for TR4 resistance, as shown inintrogressedresistance from wild relatives.[76]Bananas form a hybrid-polyploidcomplex; hybrids can be diploid, triploid, tetraploid, or pentaploid, i.e. they may have 2, 3, 4, or 5 sets ofchromosomes. This makes them difficult to breed as hybrids are often sterile, in addition to the challenge of breeding seedless (parthenocarpic) varieties.[citation needed]\n","TheHonduran Foundation for Agricultural Researchhas bred a seedless banana that is resistant to both Panama disease and black Sigatoka disease. The team made use of the fact that \"seedless\" varieties do rarely produce seeds; they obtained around fifteen seeds from some 30,000 cultivated plants, pollinated by hand with pollen from wild Asian bananas.[77]\n","As of 2018[update], bananas are exported in larger volume and to a larger value than any other fruit.[62]In 2022, world production of bananas and plantains combined was 179 million tonnes, led by India and China with a combined total of 26% of global production. Other major producers were Uganda, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nigeria and Ecuador.[78]As reported for 2013, total world exports were 20 million tonnes of bananas and 859,000 tonnes of plantains.[79]Ecuador and the Philippines were the leading exporters with 5.4 and 3.3 million tonnes, respectively, and the Dominican Republic was the leading exporter of plantains with 210,350 tonnes.[79]\n","Bananas are damaged by a variety of pests, especially nematodes and insects.[80]\n","Banana roots are subject to damage from multiple species of parasiticnematodes.Radopholus similiscauses nematode root rot, the most serious nematode disease of bananas in economic terms.[81]Root-knot is the result of infection by species ofMeloidogyne,[82]while root-lesion is caused by species ofPratylenchus,[83]and spiral nematode root damage is the result of infection byHelicotylenchusspecies.[84]\n","Among the main insect pests of banana cultivation are two beetles that cause substantial economic losses, the banana borerCosmopolites sordidusand the banana stem weevilOdoiporus longicollis. Other significant pests includeaphidsand scarring beetles.[80]\n","Although in no danger of outright extinction, bananas of the Cavendish group, which dominate the global market, are under threat.[85]There is a need to enrich bananabiodiversityby producing diverse new banana varieties, not just focusing on the Cavendish.[86]Its predecessor 'Gros Michel', discovered in the 1820s, was similarly dominant but had to be replaced after widespread infections of Panama disease.Monocroppingof Cavendish similarly leaves it susceptible to disease and so threatens both commercial cultivation and small-scale subsistence farming.[85][87]Within the data gathered from the genes of hundreds of bananas, the botanist Julie Sardos has found several wild banana ancestors currently unknown to scientists, whose genes could provide a means of defense against banana crop diseases.[88]\n","Some commentators have remarked that those variants which could replace what much of the world considers a \"typical banana\" are so different that most people would not consider them the same fruit, and blame the decline of the banana onmonogeneticcultivation driven by short-term commercial motives.[55]Overall,fungal diseasesare disproportionately important tosmall island developing states.[89]\n","Panama diseaseis caused by aFusariumsoilfungus, which enters the plants through the roots and travels with water into the trunk and leaves, producinggelsand gums that cut off the flow of water and nutrients, causing the plant towilt, and exposing the rest of the plant to lethal amounts of sunlight. Prior to 1960, almost all commercial banana production centered on the Gros Michel cultivar, which was highly susceptible.[90]Cavendish was chosen as the replacement for Gros Michel because, among resistant cultivars, it produces the highest qualityfruit. It requires more care during shipping,[91]and its quality compared to Gros Michel is debated.[92]\n","Fusarium wilt TR4, a reinvigorated strain of Panama disease, was discovered in 1993. This virulent form of Fusarium wilt has destroyed Cavendish plantations in several southeast Asian countries and spread to Australia and India.[86]As the soil-based fungi can easily be carried on boots, clothing, or tools, the wilt spread to the Americas despite years of preventive efforts.[86]Without genetic diversity, Cavendish is highly susceptible to TR4, and the disease endangers its commercial production worldwide.[93]The only known defense to TR4 isgenetic resistance.[86]This is conferred either byRGA2, a gene isolated from a TR4-resistantdiploidbanana, or by thenematode-derived Ced9.[94][95]This may be achieved bygenetic modification.[94][95]\n","Black sigatokais a fungal leaf spot disease first observed in Fiji in 1963 or 1964. It is caused by theascomyceteMycosphaerella fijiensis. The disease, also called black leaf streak, has spread to banana plantations throughout the tropics from infected banana leaves used as packing material. It affects all main cultivars of bananas and plantains (including the Cavendish cultivars[96]), impedingphotosynthesisby blackening parts of the leaves, eventually killing the entire leaf. Starved for energy, fruit production falls by 50% or more, and the bananas that do growripenprematurely, making them unsuitable for export. The fungus has shown ever-increasing resistance to treatment; spraying with fungicides may be required as often as 50 times a year. Better strategies, withintegrated pest management, are needed.[97][98]\n","Banana bunchy top virusis a plant virus of the genusBabuvirus, familyNanonviridaeaffectingMusaspp. (including banana, abaca, plantain and ornamental bananas) andEnsetespp. in the familyMusaceae.[99]Banana bunchy top disease symptoms include dark green streaks of variable length in leaf veins, midribs and petioles. Leaves become short and stunted as the disease progresses, becoming 'bunched' at the apex of the plant. Infected plants may produce no fruit or the fruit bunch may not emerge from the pseudostem.[100]The virus is transmitted by the banana aphidPentalonia nigronervosaand is widespread in Southeast Asia, Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Oceania and parts of Africa. There is no cure, but it can be effectively controlled by the eradication of diseased plants and the use of virus-free planting material.[101]No resistant cultivars have been found, but varietal differences in susceptibility have been reported. The commercially important Cavendish subgroup is severely affected.[100]\n","Banana bacterial wiltis a bacterial disease caused byXanthomonas campestrispv.musacearum.[102]First identified on a close relative of bananas,Ensete ventricosum, in Ethiopia in the 1960s,[103]The disease was first seen in Uganda in 2001 affecting all banana cultivars. Since then it has been diagnosed in Central and East Africa, including the banana growing regions of Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, and Uganda.[104]\n","Given the narrow range ofgenetic diversitypresent in bananas and the many threats viabiotic(pests and diseases) andabioticthreats (such asdrought) stress,conservationof the full spectrum of bananagenetic resourcesis ongoing.[105]In 2024, the economist Pascal Liu of theFAOdescribed the impact ofglobal warmingas an \"enormous threat\" to the world supply of bananas.[106]\n","Bananagermplasmis conserved in many national and regionalgene banks, and at the world's largest banana collection, the InternationalMusaGermplasm Transit Centre, managed byBioversity Internationaland hosted atKU Leuvenin Belgium.[107]SinceMusacultivars are mostly seedless, they are conserved by three main methods:in vivo(planted in field collections),in vitro(as plantlets in test tubes within a controlled environment), and bycryopreservation(meristemsconserved inliquid nitrogenat −196 °C).[105]\n","Genes from wild banana species are conserved asDNAand as cryopreservedpollen.[105]Seeds from wild species are sometimes conserved, although less commonly, as they are difficult to regenerate. In addition, bananas and theircrop wild relativesare conservedin situ, in the wild natural habitats where they evolved and continue to do so. Diversity is also conserved in farmers' fields where continuous cultivation, adaptation and improvement of cultivars is often carried out by small-scale farmers growing traditional local cultivars.[108]\n","A raw banana (not including the peel) is 75% water, 23%carbohydrates, 1%protein, and contains negligiblefat.

Depending upon cultivar and ripeness, the flesh can vary in taste from starchy to sweet, and texture from firm to mushy. Both the skin and inner part can be eaten raw or cooked. The primary component of the aroma of fresh bananas isisoamyl acetate(also known asbanana oil), which, along with several other compounds such asbutyl acetateandisobutyl acetate, is a significant contributor to banana flavor.[115]\n","Plantains are eaten cooked, often as fritters.[116]Pisang goreng, bananas fried with batter, is a popular street food in Southeast Asia.[117]Bananas feature inPhilippine cuisine, with desserts likemaruyabanana fritters.[118]Bananas can be made into fruit preserves.[119]Banana chipsare a snack produced from sliced and fried bananas, such as inKerala.[120]Dried bananas are ground to makebanana flour.[121]In Africa,matokebananas are cooked in a sauce with meat and vegetables such as peanuts or beans to make the breakfast dishkatogo.[122]In Western countries, bananas are used to make desserts such as banana bread.[123]\n","Banana flowers (also called \"banana hearts\" or \"banana blossoms\") are used as avegetable[124]inSouth AsianandSoutheast Asian cuisine.

Certain types of tamales are wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks.[127]\n","When used so for steaming or grilling, the banana leaves protect the food ingredients from burning and add a subtle sweet flavor.[1]InSouth India, it is customary to serve traditional food on a banana leaf.[128]InTamil Nadu(India), dried banana leaves are used as to pack food and to make cups to hold liquid food items.[129]\n","The tender core of the banana plant's trunk is also used inSouth AsianandSoutheast Asian cuisine.[130]Examples include the Burmese dishmohinga, and theFilipinodishesinubaranandkadyos, manok, kag ubad.[131][132]\n","Banana fiber harvested from the pseudostems and leaves has been used fortextilesin Asia since at least the 13th century. Both fruit-bearing and fibrous banana species have been used.[133]In the Japanese systemKijōka-bashōfu, leaves and shoots are cut from the plant periodically to ensure softness. Harvested shoots are first boiled inlyeto prepare fibers foryarn-making. These banana shoots produce fibers of varying degrees of softness, yielding yarns and textiles with differing qualities for specific uses. For example, the outermost fibers of the shoots are the coarsest, and are suitable fortablecloths, while the softest innermost fibers are desirable forkimonoandkamishimo. This traditional Japanese cloth-making process requires many steps, all performed by hand.[134]Banana papercan be made either from thebarkof the banana plant, mainly for artistic purposes, or from the fibers of the stem and non-usable fruits.
