Now, let's start the practice.\n","\n","What might a Computational Cultural Studies project—or, a project in the field of Cultural Analytics—look like? What kind of steps might it go through?\n","\n","Here's a rough sketch of some of the basic steps a project like this might go through, and a tiny little contained—and oversimplified—sample of what it might look like.\n","\n","In this course, we're going to learn a little bit about doing each step. And the aim of the more practical side of the course will be that, by its end, you can complete your own version of this own process—even on a simple level—while putting your own spin on it. So, here are what the steps (might) look like:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"UmLHnmVJ6bCl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Step One: Find Your Purpose**\n","\n","Obviously, before you begin working on a project, you need a reason, and a plan. That is to say, you need a question you might want to answer; you need a reason why you might want to use computational methods to answer this question (even if that reason is just: to learn something new!); and you need a plan: how am I going to do this?\n","\n","Of course, you can't really engage in this step meaningfully until you actually understand what a computational cultural studies project *could* look like, in theory. So, we're going to skip over it for now, in detail, and come back to it later, when you start to plan your own projects. Afterall, you can't really know if computationa methods are appropriate to answer the questions you have until you know what those questions are; moreover, you can't formulate your questions, in the first place, in a way that makes it possible to answer with computation, until you know what those methods are.\n","\n","But today, let's just say, for the purposes of this example, that this is your purpose: you're interested in 20th century American feminist short stories; and you're also interested in \"Thing Theory,\" or philosophical thinking surrounding objects; so, maybe you want to know about the kinds of things or objects that these short stories describe, and how they describe them. And maybe you're especially interested, for eaxmple, in whether these stories are prone to \"objectify\" characters of different gender identities."],"metadata":{"id":"ONMAPMRu7aQU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Step Two: Find Your Data (And Think Carefully Critically About It)**\n","\n","Well, the first thing you'll need to do is collect together some American Short Stories From the Twentieth Century. And you're going to need to find them in a form that you can manipulate digitally. So you've got a lot of questions to ask yourself. Here are just a few of them: Which short stories do I want to analyze? (Why these? What am I leaving out? Why?)? Which short stories are available to me in digital forms? Which are not? If they are not, is it feasible for me to do the labor to make them available in digital forms? Would I be violating copyright? If they are available, then what version of the text am I dealing with? Who edited or compiled it? In what way and why? The questions go on, and we'll cover them in more detail in the unit on data.\n","\n","But, for now, in this example let's keep it simple. Let's just collect one unit of \"data\" (and if you object to that word, we'll have time to discuss that too!): a single short story: The Yellow Wall Paper, By Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Of course, if this were a \"real\" computational cultural studies project, we'd probably collect a larger number of stories (though we wouldn't necessarily have to; computation can potentially tell us interesting things about even just one text).

It is quite alone, standing well back from\n","the road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of\n","English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and\n","gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners\n","and people.\n","\n","There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and shady,\n","full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors\n","with seats under them.\n","\n","There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\n","\n","There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\n","co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n","\n","That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\n","something strange about the house—I can feel it.\n","\n","I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt\n","was a draught, and shut the window.\n","\n","I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to\n","be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n","\n","But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I\n","take pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes me\n","very tired.\n","\n","I don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\n","piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\n","chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\n","\n","He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no\n","near room for him if he took another.\n","\n","He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\n","direction.\n","\n","I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all\n","care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n","\n","He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect\n","rest and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your\n","strength, my dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite;\n","but air you can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the\n","top of the house.\n","\n","It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look\n","all ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\n","playground and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred\n","for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n","\n","The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is\n","stripped off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed,\n","about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of\n","the room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n","\n","One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic\n","sin.\n","\n","It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to\n","constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame,\n","uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit\n","suicide—plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in\n","unheard-of contradictions.\n","\n","The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean\n","yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n","\n","It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\n","others.\n","\n","No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to\n","live in this room long.\n","\n","There comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me write a\n","word.\n","\n","We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before,\n","since that first day.\n","\n","I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there\n","is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of\n","strength.\n","\n","John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\n","\n","I am glad my case is not serious!\n","\n","But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\n","\n","John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no\n","reason to suffer, and that satisfies him.\n","\n","Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my\n","duty in any way!\n","\n","I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and\n","here I am a comparative burden already!\n","\n","Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am\n","able—to dress and entertain, and order things.\n","\n","It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\n","\n","And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\n","\n","I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\n","this wallpaper!\n","\n","At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I\n","was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a\n","nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.\n","\n","He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\n","bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head\n","of the stairs, and so on.\n","\n","“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\n","don’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\n","\n","“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\n","there.”\n","\n","Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and\n","said he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into\n","the bargain.\n","\n","But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\n","\n","It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of\n","course, I would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a\n","whim.\n","\n","I’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid\n","paper.\n","\n","Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded\n","arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\n","\n","Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private\n","wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that\n","runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in\n","these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give\n","way to fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and\n","habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to\n","all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good\n","sense to check the tendency. So I try.\n","\n","I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\n","would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\n","\n","But I find I get pretty tired when I try.\n","\n","It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\n","work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and\n","Julia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put\n","fire-works in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people\n","about now.\n","\n","I wish I could get well faster.\n","\n","But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew\n","what a vicious influence it had!\n","\n","There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck\n","and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\n","\n","I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\n","everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\n","unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\n","didn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\n","higher than the other.\n","\n","I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\n","know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and\n","get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain\n","furniture than most children could find in a toy-store.\n","\n","I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to\n","have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\n","\n","I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I\n","could always hop into that chair and be safe.\n","\n","The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for\n","we had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as\n","a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I\n","never saw such ravages as the children have made here.\n","\n","The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\n","closer than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as\n","hatred.\n","\n","Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster\n","itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is\n","all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\n","\n","But I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\n","\n","There comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful\n","of me! I must not let her find me writing.\n","\n","She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\n","profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\n","sick!\n","\n","But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\n","windows.\n","\n","There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road,\n","and one that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too,\n","full of great elms and velvet meadows.\n","\n","This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\n","particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\n","and not clearly then.\n","\n","But in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\n","can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to\n","sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\n","\n","There’s sister on the stairs!\n","\n","Well, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired\n","out. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we\n","just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.\n","\n","Of course I didn’t do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.\n","\n","But it tired me all the same.\n","\n","John says if I don’t pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell\n","in the fall.\n","\n","But I don’t want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his\n","hands once, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more\n","so!\n","\n","Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.\n","\n","I don’t feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for\n","anything, and I’m getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.\n","\n","I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.\n","\n","Of course I don’t when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am\n","alone.\n","\n","And I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by\n","serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.\n","\n","So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the\n","porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.\n","\n","I’m getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper. Perhaps\n","because of the wallpaper.\n","\n","It dwells in my mind so!\n","\n","I lie here on this great immovable bed—it is nailed down, I believe—and\n","follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I\n","assure you. I start, we’ll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over\n","there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth\n","time that I will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a\n","conclusion.\n","\n","I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was\n","not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition,\n","or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.\n","\n","It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.\n","\n","Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and\n","flourishes—a kind of “debased Romanesque” with delirium tremens—go\n","waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.\n","\n","But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling\n","outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of\n","wallowing seaweeds in full chase.\n","\n","The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I\n","exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that\n","direction.\n","\n","They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds\n","wonderfully to the confusion.\n","\n","There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when\n","the cross-lights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can\n","almost fancy radiation after all,—the interminable grotesques seem to\n","form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal\n","distraction.\n","\n","It makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap, I guess.\n","\n","I don’t know why I should write this.\n","\n","I don’t want to.\n","\n","I don’t feel able.\n","\n","And I know John would think it absurd. But I must say what I feel and\n","think in some way—it is such a relief!\n","\n","But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.\n","\n","Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.\n","\n","John says I mustn’t lose my strength, and has me take cod-liver oil and\n","lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare\n","meat.\n","\n","Dear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried\n","to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell\n","him how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and\n","Julia.\n","\n","But he said I wasn’t able to go, nor able to stand it after I got\n","there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was\n","crying before I had finished.\n","\n","It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this\n","nervous weakness, I suppose.\n","\n","And dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs\n","and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my\n","head.\n","\n","He said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I\n","must take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.\n","\n","He says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my\n","will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.\n","\n","There’s one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to\n","occupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper.\n","\n","If we had not used it that blessed child would have! What a fortunate\n","escape! Why, I wouldn’t have a child of mine, an impressionable little\n","thing, live in such a room for worlds.\n","\n","I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here\n","after all. I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.\n","\n","Of course I never mention it to them any more,—I am too wise,—but I\n","keep watch of it all the same.\n","\n","There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.\n","\n","Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.\n","\n","It is always the same shape, only very numerous.\n","\n","And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that\n","pattern. I don’t like it a bit. I wonder—I begin to think—I wish John\n","would take me away from here!\n","\n","It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,\n","and because he loves me so.\n","\n","But I tried it last night.\n","\n","It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around, just as the sun does.\n","\n","I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by\n","one window or another.\n","\n","John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched\n","the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I felt creepy.\n","\n","The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she\n","wanted to get out.\n","\n","I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move, and\n","when I came back John was awake.\n","\n","“What is it, little girl?” he said. “Don’t go walking about like\n","that—you’ll get cold.”\n","\n","I thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was\n","not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.\n","\n","“Why darling!” said he, “our lease will be up in three weeks, and I\n","can’t see how to leave before.\n","\n","“The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town\n","just now. Of course if you were in any danger I could and would, but\n","you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a\n","doctor, dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your\n","appetite is better. I feel really much easier about you.”\n","\n","“I don’t weigh a bit more,” said I, “nor as much; and my appetite may\n","be better in the evening, when you are here, but it is worse in the\n","morning when you are away.”\n","\n","“Bless her little heart!” said he with a big hug; “she shall be as sick\n","as she pleases! But now let’s improve the shining hours by going to\n","sleep, and talk about it in the morning!”\n","\n","“And you won’t go away?” I asked gloomily.\n","\n","“Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will\n","take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house\n","ready. Really, dear, you are better!”\n","\n","“Better in body perhaps”—I began, and stopped short, for he sat up\n","straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I\n","could not say another word.\n","\n","“My darling,” said he, “I beg of you, for my sake and for our child’s\n","sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let\n","that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so\n","fascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish\n","fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?”\n","\n","So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before\n","long. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn’t,—I lay there for\n","hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern\n","really did move together or separately.\n","\n","On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a\n","defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.\n","\n","The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating\n","enough, but the pattern is torturing.\n","\n","You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well under way in\n","following, it turns a back somersault and there you are.

The woman behind shakes it!\n","\n","Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes\n","only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all\n","over.\n","\n","Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady\n","spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\n","\n","And she is all the time trying to climb through.

I see her in\n","those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\n","\n","I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\n","carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\n","\n","I don’t blame her a bit.

Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that\n","woman out at night but myself.\n","\n","I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\n","\n","But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\n","\n","And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\n","turn!\n","\n","I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\n","fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\n","\n","If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean\n","to try it, little by little.\n","\n","I have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time!\n","It does not do to trust people too much.\n","\n","There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John\n","is beginning to notice.

Now it is time to run our analysis. Remember, a huge, pre-emptive part of this process, on an intellectual level, is considering what type of data analysis can actually answer our question. And ideally, we've done a lot of that thinking; but some of that thinking might also happen in the process of actuallty doing our analysis, as we realize mistakes we made, new complications that emerge, and so on. The process of converting a question we have into an actual process of analysis is called \"operationalizing\" that question; and it involves a lot of thought—and knowledge of the methods available (not to mention a healthy dose of self-skepticism/criticism, etc.) But let's, again, simplify for now, by assuming this (brief) line of reasoning:\n","\n","We had a question about \"objects\" in these stories and their relation to people. And the first most basic question we had was: what objects are described? and how are they described? Well, we might think about processes for answering each of those questions.

Because most objects are referred to by nouns, this might give us an idea of the objects present.\n","\n","I bet you're already coming up with a lot of good objections.
